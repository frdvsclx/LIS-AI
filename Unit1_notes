The Agent Workflow:

Think → Act → Observe.

An Agent is a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment in order to achieve a user-defined objective. It combines reasoning, planning, and the execution of actions (often via external tools) to fulfill tasks.

The Brain (AI Model):
This is where all the thinking happens. The AI model handles reasoning and planning. It decides which Actions to take based on the situation.

The Body (Capabilities and Tools)
This part represents everything the Agent is equipped to do.

The scope of possible actions depends on what the agent has been equipped with

An Agent can perform any task we implement via Tools to complete Actions.

To summarize, an Agent is a system that uses an AI Model (typically an LLM) as its core reasoning engine, to:

Understand natural language: Interpret and respond to human instructions in a meaningful way.

Reason and plan: Analyze information, make decisions, and devise strategies to solve problems.

Interact with its environment: Gather information, take actions, and observe the results of those actions.
